            Once every part of the computer has been assembled, there are only a few more steps before you're fully
            running in your brand new machine. You may follow the quick checklist below to know what to do after booting
            up your desktop for the first time.

            <div style="float: right;margin-left: 10px;">
                <a href="images/bios.jpg" target="_blank">
                    <img src="images/bios.jpg" style="width: 300px;" />
                </a>
                <p style="font-size: 10px;">An example BIOS screen <%- ref("Cutress") %></p>

            <p>
                <strong><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> First,</strong> you will want to check your <%- def("BIOS") %>. The way you access your <%- def("BIOS") %> will depend on
                what kind of motherboard you have and will require you to press a certain key when booting up your
                computer. The most common of these keys are ESCAPE, DELETE, F1, F2, F8 or F10. The <%- def("BIOS") %> menu will look
                one of two ways where you use your keyboard to navigate the menu or you are able to use your mouse to
                navigate around the menu.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <strong><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Second</strong>, if you installed <%- def("RAM") %> that has a high speed, you will need to turn
            on your XMP profile and simply change the frequency the <%- def("RAM") %> runs at to whatever they are advertised. For
            example, if your <%- def("RAM") %> is <%- def("clock speed", "3000 MHz") %>, make sure the <%- def("BIOS") %> clearly shows that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Third,</strong> you will now have to configure your boot drive for your operating system. The boot
            order determines which device your computer is going to encounter first when your computer is booting up,
            and thatâ€™ll need to be set to either the Windows installation disk or the Windows USB depending on which way
            you are installing Windows. You will want to test this by inserting Windows, if it is by CD you will want to
            turn on the computer and put the Windows CD into the CD tray. If for some reason it does not display you can
            head to the boot section in your <%- def("BIOS") %> and look at the priority of devices and you can set the boot order so
            that what ever Windows is on will be the first in the boot sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Fourth,</strong> you will be installing the operating system. When first installing Windows 10 it
            will prompt you with a window asking if you would like to install a 64-bit or 32-bit version, you will
            always go with the 64-bit version unless you have a specific reason not to. You will then be prompted with
            where you would like to install Windows, here you will want to select your SSD if available as it will load
            and boot faster, if there is no SSD available then select any Hard Drive.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Finally,</strong> you will want to update Windows. After installing windows there will be an update
            that will shortly follow so you will want to make sure that Windows is on its latest version.
