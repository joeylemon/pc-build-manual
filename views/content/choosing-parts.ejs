        <h2>Choosing Parts</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Choosing the parts to go into your computer is highly dependent on your budget. Obviously, more expensive
            components will usually yield better performance. After a certain point, however, the performance gains will
            be marginal. Therefore, we will explore budgets in the range from $500 to $2,000. If you're trying to save
            money while still having an enjoyable experience, a lower budget such as $500 is definitely doable. On the
            other hand, if you have money to spare and would really enjoy an extremely high-performance machine, a
            budget like $1,500 or $2,000 will give you exactly what you want.</p>

        <h2>$500 or Less</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>At this price range, you will not have a large degree of flexibility when selecting parts, as this is meant
            to model a budget-focused build. With that being said this build will focus not only on getting the best
            performance possible for a low price, but also on being highly upgradable when the time comes.</p>
        <p>This build will be adequate for all of the following tasks: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Playing all latest AAA video game titles at 1080p</li>
            <li>Running reasonably complex physics simulations in Solidworks or similar</li>
            <li>Editing raw 1080p footage </li>
            <li>3D modeling in Blender or similar applications </li>
            <li>Training simple neural networks </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As this build is budget-focused, it will not specialise in any particular field. Instead, it will be
            generally good at completing all of the aforementioned tasks. </p>

This is especially good if you are wanting to overclock the CPU. The pump has an RGB while the fans do not, so if you desire, you can change the color of the pump. </td>
