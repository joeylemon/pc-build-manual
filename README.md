### What is it?

This is a manual on how to build a computer, including what the components of a computer are, some optimal component choices, instructions for assembly and maintenance, and choices for upgrading down the line.

### Why?

We were assigned to create a technical manual in English 360 Technical Writing at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. This manual had to be of substanial length and exhibit good document design, visuals, organization, and clear writing.
Our group chose to create a website to make the manual more accessible and related to the use of computers. Websites also make it much easier to quickly access information throughout the manual, such as direct links to references or definitions.

### How?

We used Node.js and Express to host the web server for the manual. EJS was utilized for its template functionality, allowing us to reduce HTML code duplication for components such as navigation or page layout. Finally, Bootstrap was used to accelerate page development and form a modular grid required by the assignment.
